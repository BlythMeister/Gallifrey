Gallifrey
=========

Gallifrey will make anyone a Jira time lord!

A simple, light-weight Jira time logging companion to help you travel the Jira universe!

Why Is The App Called Gallifrey
=========

Gallifrey is the home of the time lords in the hit BBC TV show Dr Who....Need i say more?
*This product is in no way linked/affiliated to Dr Who or the BBC (apart from the name)*

Downloads
=========

Gallifrey is currently under development.
We are aiming to maintain a Beta & Stable version of the app.

###Download Links

**Please note**, the Beta is the current work in progress & I cannot guarantee that it is 100% stable! 

**Installing on Windows 8 will alert with SmartScreen, you should be able to "Run Anyway" until I can afford a proper certificate, there is no way around this!  After a couple of runs, the warning should stop**
