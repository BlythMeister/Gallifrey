Downloads

Gallifrey is currently under development.
We are aiming to maintain a Beta & Stable version of the app.

###Download Links

**Please note**, the Beta is the current work in progress & I cannot guarantee that it is 100% stable! 

**Installing on Windows 8 will alert with SmartScreen, you should be able to "Run Anyway" until I can afford a proper certificate, there is no way around this!  After a couple of runs, the warning should stop**

* Stable Release - Coming Soon!
* [Beta Release - Click Here](https://github.com/BlythMeister/Gallifrey/raw/develop/deploy/beta/setup.exe)

*Although the "stable" can also be downloaded from the "develop" branch & the "beta" from the "master" branch, i strongly recommend using the links above to guarantee correct updates!*
