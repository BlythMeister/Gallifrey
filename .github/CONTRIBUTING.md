# Raising Issues/Features

Issues are used to raise features as well as bugs.
When raised, please include as much information as possible.
A maintainer will then review & label the issue and assign it to a release milestone (where applicable).

# Pull Request Location

Please feel free to fork and send pull requests.
Requests should be sent to the develop branch & a maintainer will review and merge your requests.

# Deployment

The deployment process is manual to create, but automatic to deliver.

Any pull requests with changes to the "deploy" folder or it's content will be rejected!

Only the maintainers should be modifying the content of this folder as and when a deployment version is to be created.

#Coding Standard

All code submitted is expected to be at the same level as the rest of the application.
Code submitted should follow the same sytle also, I currently use resharper and use that to help with code format/style/conventions.

#Change Log

There is a change log locacated in the classic app.
This is an XML file which gets parsed for the change log screen.  
This is of my own creation, so please refer to the wiki re adding to change log.

Any new item you feel should be displayed to the user please add detail to the change log.
Bugs introduced and then fixed while in beta should not be presented in the change log.

#Adding Credit

Feel free to add yourself to the with thanks file to be added to the app thanks section!
