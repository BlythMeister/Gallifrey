# FAQ

## What do I do with the Windows "Smartscreen" dialog?

Windows SmartScreen messages is something we can do very little about (other than get a whole load more users!)
Until that time, please see this page for more information: [SmartScreen Help]({{ site.url }}/help/smartscreen)

## Do I need Jira to use Gallifrey

Yes, Gallifrey is a Jira extension you install on your machine.

Without a Jira connection, Gallifrey will not start.

## Do I need an active internet connection

Yes, Gallifrey has a background sync, so if your internet connection drops Gallifrey will no longer work as expected.
