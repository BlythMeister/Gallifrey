The Gallifrey brand identity has been given a bit of a refresh with a fresh app icon and logo.

The Gallifrey App now has this icon:

<img src="{{ site.url}}/images/Circle_Icon.png" alt="Circle-Icon" width="80" height="80" />

There is also a square version of the icon:

<img src="{{ site.url}}/images/Icon.png" alt="Icon" width="80" height="80" />

Along with our new icon, we have a new logo which integrates the icon clock as the "G" in Gallifrey.

<img src="{{ site.url}}/images/Logo.png" alt="Logo" width="350" height="156" />
