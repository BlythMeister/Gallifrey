# What Is Gallifrey?

Gallifrey is a simple, light-weight Jira time logging companion to help you travel the Jira universe!

With direct access into Jira you can capture your time throughout the day or week and export in bulk updating issues as you go.

Not only does Gallifrey interact with Jira, but if you have the Tempo Jira plug-in, Gallifrey will still work and even better, Gallifrey will use the Tempo API rather than the Jira API so it works exactly the same as entering time online.
