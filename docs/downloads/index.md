# Downloads

Gallifrey downloads come in 2 flavours.

We have a stable version and a beta version of the application.
The beta version will get updates and fixes faster, but has a risk of instability, whereas the stable (as it's name suggests) is more stable and has a much slower release cycle.

# Updates

Updates will download automatically into Gallifrey and you will be either prompted to restart or updates will install on your next restart.

Gallifrey has the option to automatically install updates for you, in this situation the app wil automatically restart when an update is found.
